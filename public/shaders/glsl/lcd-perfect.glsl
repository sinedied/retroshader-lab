    An LCD shader: pixel-perfect scaling, a black-matrix grid and optional RGB
    subpixel stripes, in a single pass and without moire.

    Simulates the panels of handhelds like the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance,
    DS and PSP: a grid of rectangular apertures separated by an opaque matrix,
    each aperture split into three coloured stripes.

    An LCD cell is a rectangle, and the average of a rectangular pulse train over
    an output pixel has a closed form. So rather than band-limiting a sinusoid the
    way a CRT beam profile has to be, this shader evaluates that average exactly.
    Three things follow, and they are the reason this approach was chosen:

      - The mean is exactly the aperture width at every scale factor, so the grid
        costs no brightness and needs no compensation term.
      - Contrast falls to zero on its own as cells approach the pixel grid, so
        there is no fade to tune and nothing to alias.
      - It is floor, fract and clamp. No transcendentals at all.

    This shader must render at the final output resolution, one output pixel per
    display pixel, and the sampler must be NEAREST. If its result is rescaled
    afterwards, the grid and the stripes will alias.

    Upscaling only, like pixel-perfect: below 1:1 an output pixel spans more than
    two source texels per axis and four taps stop being an average.

    PARAMETERS

      lp_grid       0.00 - 1.00   grid visibility, 0 disables it
      lp_gap        0.00 - 0.50   matrix thickness, as a fraction of a cell
      lp_subpixels  0.00 - 1.00   RGB stripe visibility, 0 disables them
      lp_layout     0 / 1         stripe order, RGB or BGR
      lp_brightness 0.25 - 4.00   output gain
      lp_gamma      0.50 - 2.00   gamma applied to the source, 1.00 disables it

    lp_gap sets the gap between rows. The gap between columns is 0.4 of it, which
    is the ratio measured off a Game Boy Color panel - its subpixels are 0.910 of
    the cell tall but 0.296 of 0.333 wide, so the row matrix is about 9% of the
    cell and the column matrix about 3.7%. The default lp_gap of 0.12 reproduces
    that, for a fill factor near the ~75% the same panel measures.

    Unlike the grid, the stripes do not band-limit themselves: their pattern
    repeats once per cell whatever their width, so below about three output pixels
    per cell they turn into colour speckle rather than fading. They are faded out
    over that range explicitly. At 1024x768 only Game Boy-sized content has real
    room for them; at 640x480 they are off almost everywhere.

    NOT SIMULATED, deliberately:

      - Response-time ghosting. It needs the previous frame, so it needs a
        feedback pass, and the intended hosts run single-pass GLSL only.
      - Backlit versus reflective response, and panel colour casts. Those belong
        to a colour pass, not to a geometry one.
      - Non-square pixels. Every panel in scope is square-pixel.

// which is where the scaler's block boundary is and where a real black matrix is.
//
// Antiderivative of the aperture profile, normalised so its mean over a cell is

// The ramp is not decoration either. A hard-edged aperture is a rectangle, and a

// fold back to low frequencies - at 3.2 output pixels per cell the third
// harmonic lands on a 16-pixel period, squarely in the visible band - and a
// one-pixel box prefilter only attenuates it by a factor of fifteen, which is
// nowhere near enough. Compared at matched contrast, widening the ramp to twice
// the matrix width takes the worst measured beat from 2.52 to 0.23, an eleven-
// fold reduction, and makes contrast far more even across scale factors as a
// side effect. Softening was first tried at fixed visibility, where it looked
// useless; it only shows up once contrast is held constant.

    // The obvious construction - scale the image, then multiply by the grid -
    // computes mean(source) * mean(grid) over each output pixel. What it owes is
    // mean(source * grid), and the two differ by the covariance of the source and
    // the grid inside that pixel. Normally that is a rounding-level distinction.
    // Here it is not, because the matrix line sits exactly on the cell boundary
    // and so does the scaler's one soft transition pixel: the two are perfectly
    // correlated, and how much they overlap changes from cell to cell at a
    // non-integer scale. Measured, that construction beats at 2.5 - twelve times
    // the visible threshold - and no amount of gamma handling touches it, because
    // it is not a gamma problem.

    // most two cells, the source is constant within each, and the grid is

    // blend - only with the weights taken from how much *aperture* falls on each
    // side of the boundary rather than how much area. Since A(B) == B at an
    // integer boundary, that costs nothing beyond the two integrals the grid
    // needed anyway, and it collapses to the plain area weights when the grid is
    // off.
